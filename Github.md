### 2. Working with Branches

**Learning Resources:**
- **Understanding Branches:** Learn how to manage code versions.
- **GitHub Branch Documentation**

**Core Commands:**

| Command                        | Explanation                                               | Analogy                                              |

| `git merge <branch>`          | Merges another branch into the current branch.           | Combining two notebook sections into one.            |
| `git branch -d <branch>`      | Deletes a branch.                                       | Tearing out an unnecessary notebook section after finishing its work.|

### 3. Collaboration and Pull Requests

**Learning Resources:**
- **GitHub Pull Request Guide**
- **Collaborating Using GitHub**

**Core Steps:**
1. Fork the project repository.
2. Make changes to your copy.
3. Push your changes and create a pull request on the original repository.

**Non-Technical Analogy:**  
Pull Request: Asking to merge your changes into a shared notebook, while explaining why they are helpful.

### 4. Advanced Concepts

**Learning Resources:**
- **Rebasing:** Atlassian Tutorial
- **Git Stash Guide**
- **GitHub Actions:** Automating workflows.

**Core Commands:**

| Command                        | Explanation                                               | Analogy                                              |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `git rebase <branch>`         | Applies changes from one branch onto another.            | Redrawing your flowchart to fit recent updates.      |
| `git stash`                   | Temporarily saves changes without committing.             | Putting sticky notes into a drawer when interrupted mid-task. |
